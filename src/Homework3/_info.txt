    Homework 3.1 - String Manipulations
    Write a program that prompts for and reads the user’s first and last name (separately).
    Then print a string composed of the first letter of the user’s first name, followed by
    the first five characters of the user’s last name, followed by a random number
    in the range 10 to 99. Assume the last name is at least five letters long.

    Homework 3.3 – Using The Random Class
    Write a program that creates and prints a random phone number of the form XXX-XXX-XXXX.
    Include the dashes in the output. Do not let the first three digits contain an 8 or 9
    (but don’t be more restrictive than that),
    and make sure that the second set of three digits is no greater than 742.

    Homework 3.6 – Heron’s Formula (Area of triangle) Using The Math Class and java string format
    Write an app that reads the lengths of the sides of a triangle from the user. Compute the area
    of the triangle using Heron’s formula in which ‘s’ represents half of the perimeter of the triangle,
    and ‘a’ and ‘b’ and ‘c’ are the lengths of the three sides. Print area to three decimal places.

    Homework 3.7: Calculating Sine, Cosine, and Tan using Math and Random classes
    Write an app that generates a random integer in the range of 20 to 40 inclusive,
    and displays the sine, cosine, and tangent of that number
    >>> CalculatingSinCosTan

    Homework 3.8: Calculating Volume and Surface of a Cylinder using Java Math class
    Write an app that generates a random integer radius (r) and height (h) for a cylinder in the
    range 1 to 10, inclusive, and then computes the volume and surface area of the cylinder.

    3-10: Displaying Images in Java Swing Panels
    Write an app that displays a frame containing two panels. Each panel should contain two images
    (use 4 unique images of your choice). fix the size of the first panel so that both of its images
    remain side by side. Allow the other panel to change size as needed.
